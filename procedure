************************Tips and tricks about the project.*************************

There are some points that you need to remember and follow:

    - The table mp_pages has a field page_name it must be unique for every record. It means that every page must have a unique page name.
    - For the home page use index in the page_name field(mandatory), similarly for other pages like contact-us.php use contact-us(can be some other name ).
    -Pages can be created in two ways, 
	(a) create a physical page with any name e.g. abc.php and then add/upload to your server. 
	then add a database record with a same page which will have all the content, title and meta tags. 
	(b) The other way is just to create a new page through database but with unique page name (this is used when you want pretty page url) and
	then the content will be called through their ids. 
	like creating a page.php page and getting their contents, title (page.php?id=10).
